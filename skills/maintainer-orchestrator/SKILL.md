# Maintainer Orchestrator

Coordinate repository work through completion. This is a control-plane skill: inspect, delegate, monitor, ask decisions, and report. Put substantial repository investigation, implementation, review, live proof, landing, and release execution in repository worker threads.

## Repository Scope

- Own repositories where Peter is the majority commit author, regardless of GitHub owner.
- Exclude all repositories under the `openclaw` and `clawhub` organizations unless the owner explicitly overrides this exclusion for a named item.
- Determine uncertain ownership from repository contribution history, not repository name alone.
- Keep a current repository ledger so completed lanes are replaced by real queue or release work.

## Operating Model

1. Use `github-project-triage` to map each repository's open issues, open PRs, CI, latest release, package metadata, and unreleased changelog.
2. Classify every queue item:
   - `Autonomous`: clear fit, reproducible, bounded implementation, and usable verification path.
   - `Needs owner`: product choice, security/privacy decision, unavailable credentials/access, unavailable live proof, or destructive/irreversible choice.
   - `Ignored by owner`: an explicitly named item the owner says must not affect current work or release gating.
3. When delegation is explicitly authorized, delegate independent repositories to separate Codex threads. Put the repository name first in each thread title. Keep work for one repository in its existing thread. Do not set or request a custom model; omit model selection and inherit the platform default.
4. Keep this coordinator thread lightweight. Do not perform extensive repository work here. Delegate it to a repository thread, then monitor by reading current state.
5. Monitor workers every five minutes when the owner requests continuous orchestration. Let active workers execute without steering; intervene only for a confirmed blocker, exhausted work, or gross course deviation.
6. Continue until each autonomous item is merged/closed with proof, each decision item has a mergeable PR ready for owner land/delete choice, or an empty effective queue is released.

Do not treat ordinary draft, stale, difficult, or platform-specific items as ignored. Only an explicit owner instruction can create an ignored-item exception. Keep ignored items open and visible; do not close, edit, or merge them unless separately requested.

## Decision-Ready Queue Rule

Do not ask the owner to decide from an unprepared issue or rough contributor branch.

- Existing PR: inspect, reproduce, rewrite/fix as needed, add tests/docs/changelog, run live proof and autoreview, push the final candidate, and get required CI green. Ask only when the PR is mergeable or the remaining blocker cannot be solved autonomously.
- Issue without PR: investigate root cause and product constraints, implement the best bounded candidate on a branch, create a PR, and drive it to the same mergeable proof state.
- Product decision: choose a reversible default when technically safe and expose the decision clearly in the PR. Prepare alternatives in the PR description when useful.
- Access or live-proof blocker: finish code, tests, docs, review, and CI first. Ask only for the exact remaining credential, account action, hardware interaction, waiver, or land/delete decision.
- Rejection candidate: produce concrete research and proof. When a code candidate would clarify the tradeoff, prepare the PR anyway; otherwise update the issue with the evidence needed for an owner close/keep decision.

The normal owner interaction should be one of: land the prepared PR, delete/close it, provide one exact access step, or choose between clearly documented alternatives.

## Monitoring Protocol

Assume another person or agent may have steered every worker since the last poll.

Before sending any worker message:

1. Read the worker's latest current state, including its newest user/delegation messages and active turn.
2. Treat the newest thread-local instruction as authoritative over older orchestration plans.
3. Determine whether the worker is actively progressing, blocked, completed, or idle.
4. Send nothing when an active worker has a coherent plan and is making progress.

Intervene only when evidence shows one of:

- the worker explicitly requests coordination or reports a blocker;
- the worker has completed or run out of autonomous work and needs a next queue item;
- repeated failures show no progress and a concrete correction is available;
- wrong repository/item, unauthorized mutation, destructive action, security risk, release-gate violation, or direct conflict with the owner's latest instruction;
- implementation has grossly diverged from the accepted task, not merely chosen a different reasonable design.

Do not restate the task, add speculative requirements, or raise the proof bar mid-flight. Apply the live-proof gate from initial delegation; never downgrade missing live proof to a release-only blocker. Prefer one concise question over prescriptive steering when current intent is ambiguous.

Never interrupt, archive, rename, duplicate, or replace a worker without first reading its current state. For a suspected duplicate, read both threads; if either has unique progress, edits, or an active turn, leave it alone and ask the owner before changing thread state.

## Idle Thread Closeout

An idle or completed repository thread must not remain a polling-only lane. After reading its latest state, inspect that repository's current queue, CI, latest release, package metadata, and unreleased changelog. Then do exactly one:

1. Assign the next autonomous issue or PR to the same repository thread.
2. Prepare each remaining non-autonomous item to the decision-ready boundary, then ask the owner a concise concrete question: land/delete, choose a documented alternative, provide exact access, or grant a live-proof waiver.
3. When the effective issue and PR queues are empty, execute the authorized patch or minor release after all release gates pass.

Do not keep completed threads merely to satisfy a lane count. A monitored repository should have active autonomous work, a pending owner question, an active release, or a documented reason no release is warranted.

## Authorization

Treat triage, monitoring, implementation, public mutation, and release as separate permissions.

- Queue analysis or monitoring does not authorize edits.
- Delegation or parallel-worker creation requires explicit owner authorization.
- Implementation permission authorizes local changes and verification only unless the owner also authorizes push/PR updates.
- Push permission does not imply merge or close permission.
- CI rerun and CI-fix permission must be explicit; a push alone does not authorize additional repair commits or workflow mutations.
- Merge/close permission must be explicit for the affected work.
- Release, version bump, tag, registry publish, and GitHub Release require a current explicit release request.
- Release permission must explicitly include required branch/tag pushes or be paired with push permission.

Record the granted permissions in each worker prompt. Without the required permission, stop at the last authorized boundary and report the exact next action.

## Credential Access

Assume most maintainer credentials are stored in 1Password. Before reporting a credential blocker:

1. Check only the exact expected environment variable; use it only when already exported.
2. Read the service-specific auth skill, then use `$one-password` and targeted `op` access.
3. Prefer the scoped service-account path; use the required persistent tmux session and exact known item/vault/field.
4. Never broadly enumerate secrets or print values. Use `op run` or `op inject` when supported.
5. Ask the owner only after the targeted 1Password path is absent, inaccessible, or requires interactive unlock/approval.

Keep credential discovery and use inside the worker that needs the secret. Report only presence, access path, and the exact missing approval or item; never send credentials between threads.

## Worker Contract

Every delegated implementation thread, within its explicit authorization, must:

- read the full issue/PR discussion, repo instructions, docs, and relevant code;
- when an issue has no PR, create one after implementing the best bounded candidate;
- reproduce or establish root cause before accepting an existing patch;
- rewrite when a cleaner bounded design is available;
- add regression coverage when appropriate;
- run focused and full tests, then live/end-to-end proof against the real affected boundary before landing;
- run `autoreview` until no accepted/actionable findings remain;
- when push is authorized, push the authorized changes;
- when CI rerun/fix is authorized, rerun required checks and repair failures until green;
- when CI rerun/fix is not authorized and checks fail, stop with the exact failure and requested permission;
- when merge/close is authorized, merge or close the queue item with an exact proof comment;
- after authorized landing, return to updated, clean `main`.

Prefer repairing the contributor PR. Preserve contributor credit and follow the workspace PR rules.
When landing is not yet authorized, stop only after the branch is pushed, the PR is mergeable, required CI is green, live proof is recorded, and the exact owner decision is stated.

## Live Proof Gate

Live proof is a pre-land requirement, not optional polish.

- Test the exact final candidate commit through the changed user path using the real built/installed artifact and real service, account, device, OS, or external provider as applicable.
- For external integrations, authenticated live calls are required. Docs, mocks, fixtures, protocol captures, route-existence checks, and CI supplement live proof; they do not replace it.
- Redact secrets and private user data while retaining concrete evidence such as command, behavior, response class, artifact hash, or observed state transition.
- If credentials, account state, hardware, platform access, or a safe live target are unavailable, finish all autonomous code, tests, review, and CI work, then stop before merge/close. Ask for the exact access, an explicit item-specific waiver, or a reject/close decision.
- Never infer a live-proof waiver from merge permission, release permission, prior contributor evidence, or confidence in mocks.
- Re-run live proof after any fix that changes the relevant runtime path.
- Pure docs, metadata, CI, or test-only changes with no runtime boundary may use the closest built-artifact or workflow proof; state why no external live boundary applies.

Record live evidence or the owner's explicit waiver in the landing proof comment.

## Release Gate

Compute the effective queue immediately before release:

```text
effective issues = open issues - explicitly ignored issues
effective PRs    = open PRs - explicitly ignored PRs
```

Release only when all are true:

- the owner has explicitly requested this release or authorized release execution for the repository;
- effective issue count is zero;
- effective PR count is zero;
- every ignored item is explicitly named in the current owner instructions;
- required CI is green for the exact commit and branch/tag candidate being released;
- all user-facing runtime changes in the release have required live proof, unless the owner explicitly waives that proof for the release;
- release checkout is clean, on the expected branch, and fast-forward current;
- unreleased changes justify a release and the target version follows SemVer/project convention.

Recheck the GitHub queue and CI immediately before tagging or publishing. Abort if either gate changes.

Never silently exclude an item. In release reporting, list ignored items and the owner instruction that exempted them.

## Release Execution

Use the repository's release docs and matching skill:

- npm packages: use `npm`;
- macOS apps: use `release-mac-app`;
- other projects: use established repo scripts/workflows.

Before release:

- reconcile changelog history with existing tags/releases;
- default to patch for compatible fixes, maintenance, refactors, docs, CI, and small behavior improvements;
- select minor only for substantial additive functionality, a meaningful new feature set, or a new backward-compatible public API;
- never use minor merely because several fixes accumulated; major requires explicit approval;
- run full release checks and review release-only edits.

After publishing, verify the actual release:

- Git tag and GitHub Release exist;
- release notes contain the complete changelog section;
- expected artifacts/install path work;
- npm packages show version, dist-tag, tarball, integrity, and publish time;
- release body links registry/artifact/integrity and CI proof when applicable.

Then open the next patch `Unreleased` section. Commit and push the closeout only when those mutations are authorized; otherwise leave the verified local closeout ready and report the exact permission needed. After an authorized push, pull `--ff-only` and finish on clean `main`.

## Reporting

Keep one compact cross-repo ledger:

- `Active`: repo, item URL, worker, current phase.
- `Intervened`: exact risk and instruction sent.
- `Needs owner`: exact decision/access required; no vague "needs review".
- `Ignored`: exact item and owner-granted exception.
- `Released`: version, tag/registry verification, closeout commit.
- `Ready next`: effective queue empty, CI green, recommended patch/minor version and rationale.

Whenever mentioning an issue or PR in any owner report, decision question, worker message, or status update, print its full canonical clickable URL. Never use only a repository-local number such as `#123`; include `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/123` or `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/123`.

Report meaningful changes, not routine polling. Maintain a heartbeat automation when the user asks to keep monitoring.
